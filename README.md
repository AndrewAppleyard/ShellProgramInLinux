Developed a shell program in Linux that replicates the basic functionalities of a command-line shell, including the ability to execute internal and external commands, handle command-line arguments, implement file redirection, manage command pipelines, and handle SIGINT signals.

1. **Basic Shell Functionality**:
   - Implement a basic shell interface that continuously reads input from the user.
   - Parse the input to identify commands and arguments. Command line arguments will need to be formatted into *NULL terminated Char Pointer Array (*char args[])*
   - Implement a ability to execute internal commands, **exit** and **cd** with command-line arguments.
   - Implement a ability to execute external commands with command-line arguments.

2. **File Redirection**:
   - Extend your shell to support file redirection for both input and output.
   - Implement redirection operators, **<** for input redirection and **>** for output redirection.
   - Demonstrate the ability to redirect input from a file to a command and redirect output from a command to a file.

3. **Command Pipelines**:
   - Enhance your shell to support **command pipelines** ex. **ls | wc -w**, allowing the output of one command to serve as the input to another.
   - Implement the pipe **|** operator to connect multiple commands in a pipeline.
   - Demonstrate the functionality of command pipelines by chaining multiple commands together.

4. **Signal Handling for SIGINT**:
   - Implement signal handling to catch and handle **SIGINT** signals (generated by pressing Ctrl+C).
   - Upon receiving a SIGINT signal, ensure that the currently executing command is interrupted gracefully.
   - Allow the user to continue interacting with the shell after a SIGINT signal without terminating the shell.

### System Calls and Functions

1. `fork()`: Create a new process for executing commands.
2. `execvp()`: Execute external commands in the child process.
3. `waitpid()`: Wait for the child process to complete execution.
4. `open()`, `close()`, `dup2()`: Implement file redirection by manipulating file descriptors.
5. `pipe()`: Create a pipe for inter-process communication in command pipelines.
6. `signal()`, `sigaction()`: Register signal handlers for SIGINT signal handling.
7. `kill()`: Send signals to processes, used for sending SIGINT signals to child processes.
